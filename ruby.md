# ASSESSMENT 4: INTRO TO RUBY
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own there is always something more to learn.   

1. In what ways are JavaScript and Ruby similar? In what ways are they different?

  Your answer:They both use object oriented computer languages, they have built in methods.

  Researched answer:JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that allows you to create dynamic HTML pages with interactive effects within a webpage. JavaScript allows you to process and maintain data within the browser. It runs on web-browser only and it is an interpreted programming language. Ruby is an open-source programming language, object-oriented language with a focus on simplicity, portability, extensibility, and productivity. As it is open-source, we can free to modify, edit according to our needs and use.
  
  In javascript you use semicolon's in ruby it's not an option. In ruby you use "end" and in java script you use open and closing curly brackets.
  in Ruby you dont need parenthesis for methods but in java they are required



2. What is a hash?

  Your answer: hashes are like libraries used to store other objects.

  Researched answer: A Hash is created by listing key/value pairs, separated by hash rockets, and enclosed by curly braces.



3. What is the testing framework used in Ruby? Describe the process of setting up the testing environment.

  Your answer: BDD AND TDD testing is used in Ruby. you have to install a gem and then use Rspec.

  Researched answer:By running your Rails tests you can ensure your code adheres to the desired functionality even after some major code refactoring. Rails tests can also simulate browser requests and thus you can test your application's response without having to test it through your browser.



4. Name three possible relationships between objects?

  Your answer: state, class, behavior

  Researched answer: All objects have an identity; they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages. These messages are normally dispatched through method calls.



5. What is an instance variable? How is it different from other variables in Ruby?

  Your answer:re-defining an object with an @symbol that can be used more than one time. If a regular variable is changed entirely.

  Researched answer: An instance variable has a name beginning with @ , and its scope is confined to whatever object self refers to. Two different objects, even if they belong to the same class, are allowed to have different values for their instance variables.
  
  An instance variable is local to a specific instance of an object. If one object changes the value of the instance variable, the change only occurs for that object. A local variable can be used only within the method in which it is defined (or, when the variable is defined at the top level, only outside of any method).



6. Ruby has a great community and tons of free resources to help you learn. [Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)is a list of great resources. Below are a few popular ones:
- [Interactive Ruby Tutorial](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)
- [Why's (poigniant) Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html): comics, anecdotes, and microscopic canaries
- [Ruby in 20 Min](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
- [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)

Choose one of these resources and look through the material for 10-15 min. List three new things you learned about Ruby:

1) When using Ruby for the readability dont use hard tabs instead use two spaces per indentation.

2) Constants canâ€™t be changed after they are set. 

3) Variables which begin with a dollar sign are global.


7. Stretch: What are blocks, procs, and lambdas?
